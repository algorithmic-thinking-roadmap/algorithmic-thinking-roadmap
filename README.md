Dear competitors,

This GitHub account is our attempt for students around the world who would like to participate in algorithmic and computational thinking olympiads.
These olympiads are a lot different from the other ones. 
Their uniqueness is because of their focus on programming skills.
We try to put the most practical and interesting programming projects of the Algorithmic Thinking book in order to provide a useful resource not only for the competitions, but for your own benefit.
Check this account weekly to receive more codes.
Feel free to use them anytime and please tell your friends to join. 

Good luck ;)

P.S. Share your experience, suggestions, etc. with us by: algorithmic.thinking.roadmap@gmail.com
